## Introduction:

My private smart contract security auditing offers a unique approach to projects that differs from traditional methods. Price is charged based on the number of bugs found in the codebase, rather than an hourly or fixed rate. This means that the clients only pay for the results they receive and not for the time it takes me to find them. In this document, I will outline my process for determining pricing, and payment policies.

## Pricing:

My pricing is based on the complexity of the protocol and the number of lines of code in the system being audited. I will discuss and agree on the cost for each low, medium, and high severity bug found during the audit. then determine a fair and reasonable price based on their budget and the level of risk associated with their smart contract.

Transparency and fairness are important, which is why I provide a clear breakdown of the cost associated with each type of bug found during the audit. This approach ensures that my clients only pay for the value they receive and have a clear understanding of the cost associated with my services.

My payment policies are designed to reflect my commitment to delivering results. Clients will only pay for the bugs found and nothing more. There is no lower limit, and my upper limit payment ensures that clients are not charged exorbitant fees, even if a large number of bugs are found.

## Conclusion:

I provide a unique and effective approach to auditing services. By charging based on the number of bugs found, my clients only pay for the results they receive, and my bug classification system ensures that issues are addressed in order of severity. My payment policies are fair and transparent, ensuring that clients receive the best value for their investment.
